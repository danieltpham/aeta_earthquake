# AETA Earthquake Prediction AI Algorithm Competition 2021
https://competition.aeta.io/

## Proposed Timeline

- Week 1 (Feb): Getting to know the data
  - Everyone to sign up on the website
  - Download the data to inspect
  - Decide on the collaboration workflow
  - See if we can read the files into Python
- Week 2 (Feb): Background research
- Week 3 (Feb): EDA + Cleaning data (1)
- Week 4 (Feb): Cleaning data (2)
- Week 1 (Mar): Model building (1)
- Week 2 (Mar): Model building (2)
- Week 3 (Mar): Model evaluation
- Week 4 (Mar): Model improvement + Code clean up
- **D-DAY: WEDNESDAY 31/3**
- Afterwards: Building web app interface (TBD)

## Questions to discuss (everyone to contribute)

- Which tools & libraries?
- What's the collaboration workflow will look like?
- What additional data can we use?
- Feature engineering vs Feature selection?
- How many models to build?
- How do we combine the results from the different models?
- What statistical models can we use as a prior / input for the ML models?
